# Profiling Tutorial

This repositiory is designed to help with the process of examining and fixing the performance of Terasology. The wiki contains information about the process of using Java FlightRecorder to record and examine the game's performance. The module itself will soon contain examples of common performance issues and how to fix them, which will be explained in detail in the wiki. For now, there is a single placeholder command. Performance examples will be implemented using commands, with the syntax `testPerformanceExampleName <boolean efficient>` where `ExampleName` is the name of the example and `efficient` controls whether to run the good or bad version of the example.
