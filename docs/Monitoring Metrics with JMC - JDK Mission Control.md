# Introduction

## Who is this for?

This document is for contributors to Terasology‚Äî
mainly developers and testers‚Äî
who want a way to peek under the hood while the game is running.

Some of these techniques can be used without a full Terasology development environment,
but you should be comfortable running Java applications from the command line.

## How is this different than Java Flight Recordings?

If you've read [Analyzing JFR Recordings], you might be wondering how this is different.

[Analyzing JFR Recordings]: https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialProfiling/wiki/Analyzing-JFR-Recordings

Flight recordings are detailed logs of events over a short period of time.
You can analyze a flight recording to learn about what happened during that time in the past.

Here we'll be exploring a different feature of JMC, its JMX Console.<sup>1</sup>
The JMX Console lets you see the _current state_ of a process.
Instead of reading a log recorded by the application, it polls it for the current value of metrics you're interested in.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
<div style="flex: 1 1 0;">

**JFR**

- üñ® writes a log file
- üì• can be attached to a bug report for later review

</div>
<div style="flex: 1 1 0;">

**JMX**

- ü©∫ connects to a live process
- üì° can connect to a remote server

</div>
</div>

<!-- The line gets increasingly blurry as Java 14 added streaming features to JFC, and JFR-over-JMX is expected. -->

#### Footnotes
1. When you see ‚ÄúMBean Server‚Äù in Mission Control, it's referring to the same thing.
Its JMX Console is the interface it provides to an application's MBean server. 


# Prerequisite: Install JMC

Download the latest stable release of [JDK Mission Control from AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/jmc.html).

Unpack the archive and run the program inside:`jmc`

<!-- As of November 2021, Adoptium does not yet provide JMC. -->


# Local Use

## Connecting to Terasology

The JVM Browser in JMC shows all Java processes running on your computer:

<img src="_media/JMC/JMC JVM Browser.webp" width="599" height="271" alt="Each is listed with its main class and process identifier. Selecting a process reveals several options." >

Choose the MBean Server for the Terasology process.
<img src="_media/JMC/JMC JMX Console - Default.halfsize.webp" width="344" height="300" style="float: right;" alt="The dashboard shows current memory and CPU usage on speedometer-style gauges, and charts recent values on line graphs.">

This should take you to an Overview with charts showing the process's current resource usage.

<br style="clear: both">

## Terasology's Metrics

By default, the Overview shows you some measurements common to all Java processes: Memory and CPU usage.
What if we're interested in something else?

We can create custom charts to include other metrics, including those unique to the Terasology engine.
Please experiment here and make the charts your own, but a word of warning:
_do not get too attached to your charts right now._
There is a good chance that JMC will not save them.<sup>2</sup>

We'll talk about how to work around that later, but first let's find out what we can look at.
Make sure you have a Terasology game running for this part;
some metrics are only collected while a world is loaded, and won't show up if you're still at the main menu.

Select the <b>MBean Browser</b> tab:

<img src="_media/JMC/JMC MBean Browser - Filtered.webp" width="381" height="227" alt="The MBean Browser shows a tree with available MBeans, and the attributes of the selected entry.">

Each MBean represents some value we can monitor.
The **Filter** control lets us search them by name:
for example, we can filter by `*fps` to find the entry for the engine's framerate.<sup>3</sup>  

Right-click on its **Number** attribute, choose **Visualize**, and JMC will prompt you about adding it to a chart.

#### Footnotes
2. At least as of JMC 8.1.0, it seems to treat every process as unique. 
When the current process ends and you connect to a different Terasology process later,
it reverts to the default configuration.
3. If your version has something named differently, it's okay.
We haven't figured out how we're categorizing all these things yet.
Regardless of the name, as long as it has a Number attached to it, you can chart it.


# Adding a Connection

The JVM browser gave us a quick way to get started,
but if we're going to be using this often it helps to explicitly define a Connection.
The two main benefits of this are:

1. It's how we make connections remotely accessible.
    This can be especially useful for troubleshooting a headless server.
2. A named Connection keeps its configuration through restarts.
    That's why it's helpful to set up even for local use.

There some tools available to help configure this for a server running in a development workspace.
An installed version can be configured this way too,
it's just a little more verbose to do so.

## Creating a password file

First we set up the username and password that will secure the connection to the JMX server.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Source**

- run `gradlew jmxPassword`
- edit `config/jmxremote.password`

### **Installation**

- Find the [`jmxremote.password.template`][passwordTemplate] file.
    You can use the linked version
    or look in the `conf/management` subdirectory of your local Java installation.
- Save a copy as `jmxremote.password` someplace that you can edit.
- Set its file permissions so it is readable _only_ by its owner,
    not open to other users on the system.

[passwordTemplate]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openjdk/jdk/jdk-11%2B28/src/jdk.management.agent/share/conf/jmxremote.password.template

<!-- tabs:end -->

Add a line (uncommented) to your `jmxremote.password` defining a password for `controlRole`.
Change it to something other than the example `R&D`.


## Setting Server Ports

The JMX server needs two open ports.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Source**

Add the `--jmx-port` parameter to the task when you start your game.
For example:

    gradlew game --jmx-port=8901

Note that because JMX requires _two_ ports,
the server in the above example will need both 8901 **and** 8902 to be available. 


### **Installation**

If you are starting the server from the `Terasology.bat` or `Terasology` script,
you can configure Java options by setting the `TERASOLOGY_OPTS` environment variable:

<code>TERASOLOGY_OPTS="-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=**8901**  
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=**8902**  
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=**config/jmxremote.password**    
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false"
</code>

Set the bold values (the two port numbers and the password filename) as appropriate for your environment.

The specifics of how to set an environment variable and ensure it is available to the Terasology script 
depend on your operating system and choice of command shell.

<!-- tabs:end -->

<!-- TODO: Launcher? -->


## New Connection in JMC

- creating the connection
- your charts should now be persistent


# TODO: Remote Use

_[üß© Help with investigating and documenting this topic is welcome!]_

We already set up the server to listen on network ports.

We also want to
- either set up SSL certificates
  + likely requires more configuration for both JMC _and_ server, which sounds no fun
- **or** make sure non-SSL ports are accessible _only_ on the loopback interface
  + then set up an encrypted tunnel to them with ssh or ‚Ä¶?


#### What would be the risk of using unencrypted connections?

The password provides some bit of protection,
but it could be intercepted from an unencrypted connection.

Worst case, an adversary with access to the port and the password can run arbitrary code in the server process.

Do not expect Terasology's module sandbox to protect against code invoked by JMX.


# Adding New Metrics to Terasology

üöß We haven't settled on the API for this yet.
Add a meter to Micrometer's global registry, and it'll be available via JMX.
